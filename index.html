Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Get a bachelor's degree.</h3>
              <p>Most TV stations require that you have a college degree, preferably in broadcast journalism. Getting a degree in English or Communications is also a big help. Some schools that have top broadcast journalism programs are Brigham Young University, University Missouri Columbia, Northwestern University, Syracuse University and Arizona State University.
Taking a wide variety of liberal arts courses, such as political science or art history, will help you get more experience with a variety of subjects and will make you a more well-rounded reporter or anchor.

              <h3>Get relevant experience at your undergraduate institution.</h3>
              <p>When you're in college, you'll have to do more than just get your bachelor's degree if you want to take your career to the next level. Join your school newspaper and get some practice writing stories, investigating leads, and understanding the hard work needed to provide your audience with a good story. If you have a local college TV station, try to involved there, eventually ending up as an anchor or reporter if you can.[7]
If your college does not have a local TV station, go for the local radio station. This will still give you some experience with interviewing others and speaking in an articulate manner.

              <h3>Get some internship experience.</h3>
              <p> You can do this over the summer, between undergraduate semesters, or even after you graduate from college. Getting an internship at a local paper can help you make connections and have a better understanding of the way a news station runs. You may not end up doing much more than answering phones and getting coffee, but if you want to get ahead, you'll have to do it -- with enthusiasm.[8] [9]
Getting this experience will help improve your resume greatly. This is the kind of thing that will back up an impressive resume reel.</p>

              <h3>Consider getting a master's degree in journalism.</h3>
              <p>Though a master's degree in journalism isn't required for you to become a TV reporter or a news anchor, it can help you get a leg up in the profession.[10] Most journalism master's programs, such as the one at Columbia University, are only one or two years long. You may have to pay out of pocket for this degree if you can't get funding or a scholarship, so choose wisely. A journalism degree can help you not only get an appreciation for the field of reporting, but it can also help you get a leg up in the application process.[11]
Additionally, going to journalism school can help you make valuable connections that may lead to jobs in the future. </p>

              <h3>Learn how to write for TV.</h3>
              <p>You of course learn some of this in school. Writing for TV is very different from writing a term paper. You need to learn how to write to the images your audience will see on TV. It’s called writing to video. Also, you should keep writing simple and stay away from legalese and clichés. You have only one shot to get the attention of folks at home.
Though news anchors most often read from their notes or from teleprompters (while improvising along the way), most reporters have to write their own copy for when they go in the field.</p>
